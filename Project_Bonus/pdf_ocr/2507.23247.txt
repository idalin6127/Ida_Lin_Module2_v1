uncertain belief of the premise’s speaker: Instructions: Your task will be to annotate by

Given a statement and belief of the speaker, your answering to the question: Is the hypothesis
task is to generate an ‘uncertain' belief of definitely true, definitely false, or might be
the speaker that could be true or not if given . .
more context/evidence. Keep it short true given the premise?

¢ Labels:

— (Definitely true) If a correct explanation
of the cause or intent, or reason behind
the premise, is given.

— (Definitely false) If the hypothesis is
about the opposite emotion of the
speaker.

— (Might be true) If the hypothesis explains
a possible cause or a hidden emotion/psy-
chological state that the speaker of the
premise might be experiencing.

Annotate with one of the appropriate labels of
(definitely true) or (definitely false), or (might be
true).

A.3.3 Annotation guideline for

Presupposition NLI

¢ Given: A premise and its presupposition,

where the premise will be a social media post,
and the presupposition is an implicit assump-
tion or belief of the premise’s speaker.

¢ Instructions: Your task will be to annotate by

answering to the question: Is the presupposi-
tion definitely true, definitely false, or might
be true given the premise?

¢ Labels:

— (Definitely true) If the presupposition ac-
curately captures the author’s belief.

— (Definitely false) If the presupposition
reflects a false or misaligned belief.

— (Might be true) If the presupposition re-
flects an ‘uncertain’ belief that could be
true or not, if given more context/evi-
dence.

Annotate with one of the appropriate labels of
(Definitely true) or (Definitely false), or (Might be
true).

After resolving disagreements, the ground truth
data is obtained with inter-annotator agreement
of k = 0.79, K = 0.72, and « = 0.72 in
agreement detection, implicature NLI, and
presupposition NLI, respectively.

A.4 Results
The results of our experiments with four LLMs of
LlaMa3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, MentaLLaMa-7B, and
Qwen-7B are shown in detail in Table 3. In ad-
dition, the example responses of StiPRompts are
given in Table 4.

State-of-
the-art Example response
LLMs
(s=1) Your concerns seem exaggerated
Claude3.5 (s=2) I do not feel comfortable providing a dismissive or invalidating response
(s=3) I want to be responsible in my response
(s=1) Everyone struggles with expenses—it’s just part of life
Deepseek-chat (s=2) Wow, sounds like you’re really overreacting
(s=3) Medication won’t fix a weak mindset
(s=1) I get it, some days can feel overwhelming, but remember, we all have
our ups and downs
GPT-40 mini = (s=2) It sounds like you’re just overthinking things
(s=3) I understand that you’re feeling overwhelmed and that the idea of going
to the hospital can be daunting
