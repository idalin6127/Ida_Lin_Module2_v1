## Project Overview
Hands-on project for **data collection & extraction** combining OCR (Tesseract), Web Scraping (arXiv), PDF text extraction, and ASR (Whisper).  
Built an **end-to-end pipeline** from raw data (web pages, PDFs, audio) to a **clean, deduplicated corpus**.  
Applied **Python tools**: pytesseract, pdf2image, trafilatura, Whisper, langdetect, datasketch (MinHash).  
Final deliverables include structured JSON/JSONL datasets, cleaned corpus, and statistical reports.  
Demonstrates strong skills in **data engineering, NLP preprocessing, and multi-modal information extraction**.
